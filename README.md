January 16, 2018: My parter Marc and I traveled to downtown Ottawa to take pictures of the Terry Fox Statue that we would use to make a 3D model.
Marc and I brushed off as much snow as we could, but that the light snow that had been falling might have created a problem with the clarity of the pictures.
The first pictures that I took were of too low of an angle and did not capture the upper details of the statue.
To get a better viewpoint, Marc got on my shoulders and he was able to take pictures that showcased the statue entirely. 
January 17, 2018:  Met with Professor Graham in the Underhill Computer Lab to use the software Regard 3D in order to attempt to create a digital model.
We Created the file named Terry Fox file.
