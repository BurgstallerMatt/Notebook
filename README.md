Photogrammetry

first step is scanning somthing and turning it into digital.  

structure from motion is the most common system> more round object and scans the stills.

you just need a camera, good quality photo graphs are enough.

sustainability is an issue with new 3d models as they keep getting bought out and shut down

stories are important for digital history ojects 

Archaeologists are stating to do 3d models of sites every day they dig.  (look at english heritage)

clean clear sharp photographs from a variety of depths.  min of 15 photos max of 40, 20-30 best bet.

The camera matches the points in the images , uses information is the metadata to find out where the camera was and then creates model

computational creativity is the study and simulation by comptational means of beahviour , natural and artifical which would if observed by huans be determined as creativity 

Nero networks have enabled computer to be creative

better question are ontoloical; what are the thses things, why are they the was they are, how did they get this way, what do they mean

framwork for how to look at digital history

people came up with metephorical ideologies about how to program computers 100 years before they were created

different ways to draw boundares in history create different results for history.  when exivating in achaeology one can find a lack of some things. archaeology is not recordong its interveining. psudomorphs are replications but also interventions of historic sight.


Two grids : forces definging the quality of object.  permeability vs persistance

There are a whole series of privious actions that take place to create a model of history, their actions get lost in time if not documented

Picture Bohemia , 15th century

Mechanics, catingency, histography, are all the same thing
